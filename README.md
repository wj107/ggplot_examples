## Base Graphs

Random data frames generated by the scripts in the [`sample_data`](https://github.com/wj107/sample_data) repository are saved as `RData` files in the `sample_data` folder.  This repository contains scripts to create graphs which represent the data in various ways.  No summaries or statistical calculations of the data is performed, here:  this is simply basic representation of the data, where each variable gets its own graphical aesthetic.

The next step:  the repository `graph_overlays` will provide layers to these basic graphs that represent summary statistics or measures for further analysis of the data.  Coming soon!!
