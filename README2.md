# Sample Data

To practice working with data and creating data visualizations, I've created several random data frames.

Data frames generated by these scripts have been saved as R data files, and using the scripts in the [`base_graphs`](https://github.com/wj107/base_graphs) repository, sample visualizations for the data is given.

Next step:  layer 'summary' scripts to the graphs, given germane statistical information for each type of graph.  Coming soon!!!
